Why is BigDecimal better than double for representing dollar amounts?

	Doubles do not offer a way to control how numbers are rounded or a way to limit
	the precision in computation. BigDecimal gives this control.
	
List 3 good practices related to exception handling.

	1.} A debugging practice: including cause of Exception in stack-trace. This helps
	discover the source of an exception and provide information on the root of the 
	exception.
	
	2.} A debugging practice: provide detailed/meaning-full messages on Exception.
	This helps point out the cause of the problem. Also helps find the source of the 
	exception.
	
	3.} Latency: Exceptions are costly. Exceptions cause code to slow down. If you can,
	use boolean variables instead, rather than just throw and catch exception. Avoid 
	unnecessary Exception handling by fixing root cause.
